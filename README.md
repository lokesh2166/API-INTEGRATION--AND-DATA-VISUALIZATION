Introduction:
Data is the backbone of modern decision-making, and public APIs provide a valuable source of real-time information. One of the most popular public APIs is OpenWeatherMap, which provides weather data for any location across the world. In this project, we will fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap using Python, process and analyze it, and create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. This project will help in understanding how to interact with APIs, process JSON data, and use visualization libraries to present insights effectively.

Objectives:
1)Fetch real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
2)Process and clean the data to make it usable for analysis.
3)Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4)Create a simple visualization dashboard to display insights.

Technologies Used
1)Python: For scripting and data processing.
2)Requests: To fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
3)JSON: For parsing the API response.
4)Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
5)Pandas: For data manipulation and structuring.

Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Setting Up the API
To fetch weather data, we need to register on OpenWeatherMap and obtain an API key. This API key allows us to make requests to get weather data for a specific city or a set of cities.
Step 2: Processing the Data
Once we receive the JSON response, we extract relevant details such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather description.
Step 3: Visualizing the Data
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we can create various visualizations to analyze the weather data more effectively.
Step 4: Creating a Dashboard
To make the project more interactive, we can integrate the visualizations into a dashboard using Streamlit.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to fetch data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap), process it, and create meaningful visualizations using Python. By leveraging Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Streamlit, we can present data in an intuitive and visually appealing way. This approach can be extended to various other APIs, making it a versatile method for real-world data analysis and visualization.
